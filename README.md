###Installation
---
Simply just add one of the above stylesheets in the `themes` folder to the source of swagger-ui theme html page. Make sure to either remove/comment out the link to `screen.css`  or load the desired theme after it to override the Swagger UI styles.

Feel free to open an issue or suggest more themes!

###Demo
---
The [Swagger Petstore](http://petstore.swagger.io/#/) example was used as the example to showcase different themes. In the demo folder, open the index.html file and either remove or comment out the link to the 'screen.css' in the <head> tags. Next add a link to the desired stylesheet theme. Serve up the index.html locally to view theme.
